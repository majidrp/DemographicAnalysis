     <h3>Introduction</h3>
     <p> This site was created as a group project for our Scientific Visualization class in Fall 2016 at The University of Utah.</p>

     <p> The purpose of this site is to analyze demographic analysis across the United States based on various
         attributes that are selected by the user. These range from age, sex, education, and race. </p>

    <p> The reason that this type of visualization is important is that it can be used to understand
        cultural differences between areas, and can also be used for marketing reasons for target demographics.
        This can lead to better spending of advertising revenue while being able to visualize where it will be
        spent. As this is a chart for different years, it can also be used to show how population demographics in
        certain states and counties has changed over time. The data ranges from 2010 through 2015. </p>

    <h3>About the data</h3>

    <p>The data was downloaded from the United States Census Bureau's
      <a target="_blank" href="http://factfinder.census.gov/">American Community Survey</a>. </p>

    <blockquote>
      The American Community Survey helps local officials, community leaders and businesses understand
      the changes taking place in their communities. It is the premier source for detailed information
      about the American people and workforce.
      <br><div id="quote-source">United States Census Bureau</div>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Census Bureau provides the data in easy .csv format with the info we need from
      2010-2015 with the appropriate categories.</p>

    <p>After calculating the percentages for the year in question, the percentages
    are multiplied together for each attribute that the user selects. For example,
    if a user chooses males 18-34 who are divorced, the site
    calculates the percentage of the population that fits these attributes. It then
    takes this percentage and multiplies it by 100, which is telling the user
    the number of people out of 100 in that location that fit those attributes. </p>

    <p><b>Note:</b> The ACS is a yearly study that the US Census Bureau conducts.
      It does not get data for every county, instead it chooses a select few and
      then extrapolates that to values for the entire state. Therefore, the only
      counties which are colored are those for which the data was provided.
    </p>

    <h3>How to use this site</h3>

    The selections are on the left side of the screen. After selecting, simply
    click the "submit" button to update the map and charts.

    <p>
    When selecting, if no category is selected, then the site assumes that you
    wanted all in that category. For example, if you don't select a race, then
    it chooses all races when it performs the calculation.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you change the year slider at the top of the page, it automatically
      updates the map based on the values that are selected in the attributes box.
    </p>
